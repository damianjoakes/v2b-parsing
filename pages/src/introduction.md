# Introduction

**View to Binder Parsing _(V2B)_** is a method for parsing programming languages,
designed with speed, language-agnosticism, and ease-of-use in mind.

Throughout the development and conceptualization of this project, this guide 
will serve as: 
- Documentation for the concepts and best practices when parsing with this technique
- Documentation for how to use the provided library (when that library has 
  been developed.)

## Contributing and Usage
This technique is meant to be just that- a technique. The concepts discussed in 
this book are all (currently) theoretical and are meant to serve as guides and
ideas for others who wish to use or build upon this parsing technique.
