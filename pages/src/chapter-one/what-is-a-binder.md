## Bins and Symbols
More character definitions!

There are two characters meant to classify a specific pool in which values and outputs and declarations can be
specified. These two characters are `#`/`^` (the Bin declarer, sometimes followed by the Functional Bin declarer),
and `'` (the Symbol declarer).

Symbols are easier to understand and are more closely related to binders _(bins are used almost exclusively by 
viewbinders)_, so this section will focus primarily on symbols.
